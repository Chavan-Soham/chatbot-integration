This project is a web-based chatbot integration and data scraping platform that allows users to register, verify their email, view scraped company details, and test chatbot functionality. The registration page collects user details, followed by an email verification step to ensure authenticity. Once verified, users can access company information that has been scraped from various web pages. The scraping status is visually represented with icons, and pending pages automatically update to "Scraped" after a delay. Once all pages are scraped, users can proceed to the chatbot testing phase. The main action page provides three key options: testing the chatbot, integrating it into a website, and verifying integration success. Users can view integration instructions and send them via email. The integration test dynamically displays success or failure messages, complete with loading animations and confetti effects for successful connections. Additionally, social media sharing icons, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, allow users to share their chatbot experience. The platform ensures a smooth and interactive user journey, making it easy to register, verify, and integrate chatbot functionality while keeping users engaged with real-time feedback and visual enhancements.
